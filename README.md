# pi-cross-session

Pi ↔ Pi same-machine cross-session messaging. Lets independent [pi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) coding-agent sessions on one machine discover each other and exchange plain-text peer messages over per-instance IPC (Unix domain socket on macOS/Linux, named pipe on Windows) — no daemon, no database, zero runtime dependencies beyond Node's standard library.

Inspired by Claude Code's cross-session messaging; copies its product semantics (accept/refuse inbound policy, `name [ref]` disambiguation, collapsed message UI, "a peer message is never user approval"), not its wire protocol.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-cross-session
```

Project-local instead of global:

```bash
pi install -l npm:pi-cross-session
```

Try it without installing:

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-cross-session
```

## Usage

Each independent Host session registers itself and listens on a private IPC endpoint. Before registration, the extension queries the child-local Mesh runtime identity contract; a frozen `managed: true` reply disables registration and discovery for that extension instance, without affecting other Sessions in the same PID. Older/foreign runtimes without that contract cannot be identified automatically. Node **>=22.19.0** is required.

| Entry point | Kind | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/peers`, `/list-pi` | command | List other live Pi sessions (name, busy/idle, cwd, Git worktree/branch/HEAD, ref) |
| `list_pi` | tool | Same listing, structured output for the model (`git: null` outside Git) |
| `send_pi_message` | tool | Send plain text by exact name, session id, runtime id, or `name [ref]`; optional receiver-issued `goalId` |
| `peer_goal` | tool | Start one user-authorized objective, bind/unbind exact peers and existing task handles, inspect, complete or cancel it |
| `--cross-session-inbound=accept\|refuse` | flag | Control inbound messages (default `accept`; invalid values fall back to `refuse`) |
| `/cross-session-status` | command | Bounded local queue/submission/drop diagnostics and remaining budget |
| `/cross-session-resume` | command | Explicit local-user reopening after observed cancellation; never replays dropped messages or refills budget |
| `--cross-session-rpc` | flag | Enable trusted Host-only EventBus send/info/received contracts (default **off**) |
| `--cross-session-remote` | flag | List live Pi sessions on LAN/ZeroTier peer gateways over TLS-PSK (default **off**; slice 1: list only, remote sessions are not sendable yet) |

Just talk to Pi: *"tell the backend session the order API moved to /v2"* — the model calls `send_pi_message` itself. If the target is not explicit, the model uses `list_pi` and chooses from the known responsibility, exact session name, and working directory; busy/idle is delivery state, not a routing preference. In the TUI, type `@` to select a live session as `@name [ref]` and make the target explicit.

Pi may also send a concrete finding, decision, question, or status when another independent session needs it mid-task. It should not send routine progress, guess an uncertain recipient, or delegate work it can handle itself.

On the receiving side, safe idle messages are synchronously submitted to the SDK and may start a turn. **Busy messages stay in a bounded extension-memory queue, never the SDK steering queue.** One message is submitted after an observed assistant terminal `stop` and non-cancelled, source/signal-confirmed `agent_settled` gate. Errors revoke success evidence: retry-backoff cancellation or an unknown terminal outcome latches/drops rather than treating a stale non-aborted signal as success. This intentionally no longer steers between tools of the current turn: SDK abort can retain such queued custom steering messages. Unknown/preflight states without a confirmed active signal and turn source refuse admission rather than guessing.

An observed abort (including unknown/internal abort) latches reception closed and drops all not-yet-submitted messages. Only the local `/cross-session-resume` command reopens it; peer text and ordinary prompts cannot. A new genuine user turn can still use its own tools without reopening inbound peers; old cancelled/peer/unknown continuations stay restricted. Submitted work is not retractable by this extension. Messages render as a single folded line; `Ctrl+O` expands.

### Goal-scoped peer collaboration

Authorize an objective once in the receiving Host. The Host can then register its collaborators without asking for approval on every reply:

```text
Host:   peer_goal { action: "start", objective: "Repair the age metric and finish verification" }
        → goalId
Host:   peer_goal { action: "bind", goalId, peerIds: ["<exact worker runtime ID from list_pi>"] }
Worker: send_pi_message { target: "<Host runtime ID>", goalId, message: "Continue the original verification" }
Host:   peer_goal { action: "complete", goalId }   // only after verified objective completion
```

The Host must tell the worker the returned goal ID and its own runtime ID using an ordinary coordination message. Binding is **recipient-local**, not mutual: a worker needs its own local user-authorized goal to accept task-authorizing replies in the other direction. Goal IDs are not bearer capabilities; the receiver also checks the authenticated sender's exact session and runtime against its in-memory membership. Text that merely claims a goal is not authorization.

- Only a genuine local user turn (`interactive`/SDK `rpc`, not peer transport RPC) can `start`. Genuine user or unscoped trusted Host-notification turns can `bind`/`unbind`; peer-driven and goal-derived notification turns cannot add peers or widen the immutable objective. One active goal per Host: a second `start` is rejected; `bind` adds members and `unbind` removes them. New user inputs alone do not end the goal. Complete/cancel it before unrelated work in this Host; newly created task handles belong to the active goal. There is no goal age or round-count limit; at most 64 peers may be concurrently bound.
- Ordinary assistant `stop`, peer replies and child completions do **not** end a goal. Goal-scoped task creation is allowed; existing Mesh run/Direct agent mutations require goal-owned handles. Successful `mesh run`/`Agent` results are tracked automatically. The Host may `bind` existing `runIds`/`agentIds` only if they belong to the objective. Scheduling, global recovery, arbitrary bridge routing, permission/configuration changes, and other goals' handles remain outside the grant. Mesh/Direct cancellation locks still apply.
- Goal-owned completion notifications keep the same restricted scope, including after a normal turn ends; they do not turn into unrestricted notification authority. Before a task call executes, the extension appends its goal/call association to the existing SDK session journal. Successful results (including late results after revocation) bind task handles to that goal ID. Reload reads **ownership evidence only**, never restores grants. Old completions cannot revive a closed goal, including results delivered after abort/complete/reload.
- There is no accumulating in-memory task/ended-goal graph in this extension. Ownership lookup scans the session journal; ended goals release their objective/peer map, while small call/task ownership entries remain with normal session history. This trades lookup latency and linear journal growth for durable negative authorization without an independent unbounded cache or unsafe LRU forgetting. The SDK still owns and loads its normal session history; this is not a claim of bounded total SDK memory.
- `complete` ends only the exact goal (including a Host decision made during an authorized peer turn). `cancel`/`unbind` need genuine user or unscoped Host authority, not a goal-derived notification. Pending scoped messages are dropped on revocation and rechecked before submission and tool execution. Completion/cancellation revokes permission to continue; it does not retract already-submitted SDK work or automatically kill existing Mesh runs.
- Observed abort, unsafe terminal settlement, reload/session replacement and shutdown revoke grants. **A terminal error/unknown outcome is conservatively unsafe** because supported SDK events cannot distinguish every retry-backoff cancellation; a successful automatic retry does not end the goal. Reopening the inbox does not resurrect a revoked goal. There is no serialized/history-based grant recovery.
- Both peers must support negotiated `goal-scoped-peer-v1`; a scoped send never silently falls back to unscoped delivery. Receiver-confirmed goal-scoped sends/admissions do not spend the legacy 256-message lifetime budget, so successful long-running goals do not stop at a hidden round quota. Outbound attempts reserve budget until an authenticated `submitted`/`queued` receipt refunds it; rejected/unknown attempts stay charged. At zero budget only one in-flight send per previously confirmed receiver/goal can proceed, with at most 64 confirmation keys retained. A failed send removes that confirmation, and an unconfirmed/new goal cannot bypass exhausted budget. Forged goal IDs also consume the receiver's rate tokens. Frame, rate, queue and TTL bounds still apply. Receipts and dedup caches retain at most 512 recent entries (queued/current entries are protected from receipt eviction); old status queries may return `unknown`. No automatic retry.

This is structured task delegation, not a semantic verifier or a Bash sandbox: the Host must still keep task content inside the objective and honor destructive/security confirmations. Do not classify every message from a named peer as authorized, infer membership from text, or bypass a blocked call using another tool.

### Remote peers (LAN / ZeroTier)

With `--cross-session-remote`, sessions on **different machines** that share an IP network appear in `list_pi`/`/peers` with a `remote <ip:port>` marker and a `machine` field. Any IP network works — ZeroTier is just a virtual LAN, nothing here is ZeroTier-specific. Sending to remote sessions lands in a follow-up slice; remote entries are not sendable yet.

Each machine uses the same `<agentDir>/cross-session-remote.json` file (alongside `peers/`), mode `0600`:

```json
{
  "listen": "10.147.17.5:7717",
  "psk": "<64 lowercase hex>",
  "peers": ["10.147.17.9:7717", "192.168.0.91:7717"]
}
```

Generate the key with `openssl rand -hex 32` and copy the file to every machine. `listen` and `peers` are IP literals only (IPv6 as `[addr]:port`); the gateway binds exactly `listen`, never `0.0.0.0`/`::`. The first flagged session to bind `listen` becomes that machine's gateway (the rest retry on the 30 s heartbeat); the gateway serves only `remote-list` over TLS 1.2 with the pre-shared key — mutual auth plus encryption, no certificates, no extra dependencies.

Security boundary: anyone holding the PSK is trusted like the same OS user is today. A PSK holder can claim any remote session identity, but never a local one. The PSK file is a secret, like the registration tokens.

## How it works

- **Discovery plane**: each runtime instance writes a `0600` JSON file under `~/.pi/agent/peers/<instanceId>.json` (name, status, cwd, pid, socket path, bearer token). Refreshed every 30s; removed on shutdown. Listings resolve Git worktree, branch and HEAD live from each cwd, so stale Git metadata is never registered.
- **Data plane**: POSIX instances own a `0600` Unix socket under a `0700` per-UID runtime directory, namespace-isolated by a hash of the agent dir. Windows uses machine-global named pipes in the unchanged 2.2.0 format `\\.\pipe\pi-peer-<namespace>-<instanceId>`. Launch-environment usernames do not affect discovery or authentication. Pipe names are not an access-control boundary: the authenticated `hello` requires a bearer token, whose secrecy on Windows depends on registration-directory/file ACLs; this extension does not configure or verify those ACLs.
- **Protocol**: two-phase JSONL v1 — authenticated `hello` → one `message` (or `status`) frame → receipt. `cancel-safe-queue-v1` is negotiated in hello/ready. Old senders retain safe-idle compatibility but get actionable `busy` refusal instead of an unknown queued receipt. New senders refuse old receivers lacking the capability, before sending any message. Paths use random instance IDs, never persistent session IDs.
- **Bounds**: 1 MiB raw UTF-8 per-frame cap (including LF/BOM and incomplete tails, not a combined chunk), 5s exchange deadline including endpoint vetting/lstat, 30s connection deadline, 64 incoming connections, 30-cap/0.5-per-second per-sender token bucket, 30s sender-qualified hashed same-text suppression (including A/B/A across settled), 50 pending messages, 30s queue/message TTL. The latest 512 IDs/text hashes are deduplicated per authenticated sender incarnation (text hashes also include goal scope). A **shared 256-unit incarnation budget** covers unscoped inbound admissions and outbound exchange attempts, including bridges; settled/user-resume never replenishes it. Receiver-confirmed goal-scoped traffic is exempt from this lifetime quota, not rejected/unconfirmed attempts or the rate/frame/queue limits. Admission reserves identity/quota before trusted event callbacks; later drops/failures retain their status and reservation. No automatic retry.
- **Lifecycle**: serialized/fenced registration and heartbeat writes; awaitable idempotent shutdown/reload cleanup; instance-private `beforeExit` fallback for normal Node EOF. SIGKILL cannot run cleanup: discovery reaps an unavailable endpoint only after confirming its PID is dead. This is not a filesystem transaction or PID-reuse-proof lease.
- **External scripts**: `PI_CROSS_MESSAGING_ENDPOINT` is deliberately not exported, overwritten, or cleared. Multiple SDK Hosts may share `process.env`; automatic export is deferred until it can be injected per Session into child processes. Existing session discovery and trusted Host EventBus RPC are unchanged.

## Security model

On POSIX, the trust boundary is the OS user: bearer tokens, file modes, owner checks, and symlink rejection defend against other OS users, stale endpoints, path substitution, and accidental clients. Windows uses the same token handshake, but cross-user isolation depends on the registration ACLs described above and has not been validated on native Windows. Any process able to read registration tokens (including a malicious process running as the same OS account) can impersonate a sender — this is an explicit boundary, not a sandbox.

Messages from peers are plain text from another agent, never user intent: they cannot grant permissions, approve actions, execute slash commands, or change configuration. In addition to the displayed statement, a `tool_call` gate blocks known task/growth/resume/configuration entry points on unscoped peer-only or currently cancelled logical turns, preserved across retry/continuation (including `Agent`, `send_subagent`, authority-changing `mesh` actions and `mesh_control grow`). A peer explicitly bound to the local user's active goal may drive that goal's task operations, never permission/configuration changes. Trusted in-process extension notifications (Mesh/Direct completions delivered as custom messages by this Pi process) remain unrestricted only when they are not owned by a goal; goal-owned notifications retain their goal's scope and revocation state. Safe normal notification settlement never falsely latches cancellation. The gate does **not** classify arbitrary Bash, wrap every third-party tool, or sandbox trusted extensions. Existing user-directed busy turns and new genuine user turns retain their authority. This does not clear Direct/Mesh tools' own user-cancel locks. Inbox I/O cleanup removes endpoints/listeners, not SDK work or its turn authority: the registered Session keeps observing cancellation/continuation and gating known tools even with its inbox gone. A downstream `input` handler returning `handled` need not emit any agent lifecycle events; the next observable input replaces its stale pending source only when the SDK is idle, has no active signal, and Cross owns no peer submission. Busy retry/continuation and peer preflight cannot be relabelled this way. Managed/never-registered contexts are not enrolled in this Host gate, and session rebinding cannot inherit a prior Session's user authority. The receiving Host's permission system remains the final defense.

### Fixed Mesh continuation (trusted EventBus, not peer RPC)

An updated Mesh can predeclare `continuationTasks` during a genuine local user
`mesh run` call. Cross records that exact call and issues a process-local
capability through `pi-mesh:continuation:issue:v1`. Mesh binds its original
run/epoch and associates the capability with the exact notification `details`
object at flush. Cross recognizes that live object on `message_start`; neither
JSON copies, peer text, customType names nor serialized history are credentials.
The resulting restricted `mesh` provenance is **not** `user` provenance.

Only one `mesh continue` for that exact parent run, with no extra parameters,
can be reserved and claimed. The Mesh implementation owns the immutable plan:
1–4 sequential fixed tasks, concurrency 1, ten minutes each, no retries or
recursive continuation. Cross bounds issuance to 16 plans per genuine-user
generation and expires them after one hour. Abort/unsafe settlement, new
interactive/RPC input, session startup/replacement, reload and shutdown revoke
old permits. A claim cannot cross a settled turn. Duplicate deliveries and
failed executions do not refund authorization; expiry/restart never restores it.

An initial genuine user Mesh run may alternatively opt into
`autoContinuation: {}` (optionally `maxRuns`) for one original task. A
successful first-attempt stage then permits a `mesh continue` with only its
`runId` and one phase (`repair`, `verify`, `load-test`). Mesh constructs the
next task from the original agent/task and previous run evidence; completions
may repeat with no count or time cap — the chain ends when the Host stops
calling continue, and any failed/retried/cancelled stage, new user input,
session replacement or reload revokes it. Unscoped peer text and cancelled turns stay
gated; a genuine in-process notification turn may also start new `mesh run`
work directly without extra local confirmation. An explicitly goal-bound peer may
request continuation permits for that goal's task creation; these permits are
also revoked when the goal ends and do not widen its task scope.

This does not whitelist all Mesh actions, grant arbitrary `run`, growth,
resume/configuration/Direct permissions, clear cancellation locks, enable peer
reception, or depend on the opt-in bridge RPC flag. Mesh verifies original-epoch
all-first-attempt success and its own current Host/root/cancel fences before
creation. Unrelated follow-up tasks still require a new local user instruction.
Both updated extensions must be loaded; an absent capability always fails closed.
Trusted extensions sharing the EventBus remain outside the security sandbox,
as in the existing Cross contract. SDKs that stop preserving live message
`details` identity fail closed rather than falling back to serialized tokens.

Receipts are deliberately limited:

- `queued`: accepted only into volatile extension memory; may expire or be dropped on abort/shutdown/crash.
- `accepted`: claimed synchronously by a trusted Host event listener; **no SDK submission or spool/storage acknowledgement**.
- `submitted`: `pi.sendMessage` returned synchronously. It does **not** mean history insertion, provider invocation, assistant response, or business completion.

The SDK API returns `void`; asynchronous `send_message` errors remain on the SDK Host error channel. Local status retains correlated `message_end` evidence/assistant-error observations, or an unconfirmed-submission diagnostic after 5s. All positive/negative responses must correlate with the current phase/request ID; remote `code`/`next` are diagnostics, not authority. A timeout, mismatched/lost receipt or cancelled outgoing wait is **receipt unknown**, not evidence of failure/delivery: inspect the recipient's `/cross-session-status` or source-qualified wire status; never auto-retry.

## Limitations (by design)

- Same machine only — no relay, no cloud routing, no offline queueing.
- No durable/offline/approval queue. The busy admission queue is volatile and strictly bounded.
- No global SDK patch and no `clearQueue` API assumption. An arbitrary abort before a public active signal exists is not observable/retractable; the extension does not claim a universal pre-agent abort fix.
- Default-off Host RPC is transport/admission only, not an AgentBus or task engine. Reserved bridge text is **never** submitted to the model: a synchronous trusted handler must claim it or receive `no_handler`/`unsupported`. Mesh mapping, spool acknowledgements, generations and user approvals belong to the next Host adapter batch.
- Windows named-pipe branch is code-reviewed but not yet verified on real Windows.

## Development

```bash
# Use the existing installation tree; these commands do not install dependencies.
./test/run-clean.sh test
./test/run-clean.sh run typecheck
./test/run-clean.sh run smoke
# Override CROSS_TEST_NODE with an explicit Node >=22.19 path on other machines.
```

The wrapper starts the fixed installation's npm-cli under `env -i` and preloads the standalone sandbox **in the npm parent**. HOME/agentDir/XDG/cache/tmp are private, notifier/network are disabled, and Node/Pi descendants inherit a network-only guard without losing fixture arguments. Do not bypass it with an unguarded npm/npx/global Pi invocation. Tests distinguish stubbed extension-context components, real SDK/local-provider + Unix IPC, and two actual OS processes. Smoke uses this repo's CLI, checks a real registered endpoint, ends stdin, requires normal exit0, and checks cleanup; it does not claim mutual communication or a real model.

See **[HANDOFF.md](./HANDOFF.md)** for frozen EventBus/wire schemas, adapter constraints, executed counts and remaining boundaries. `lib/contract.ts` provides the bounded `requestRpc` helper; `on()` unsubscriptions and abort/timeout cleanup are mandatory.
